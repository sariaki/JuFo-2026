Based on the problem of software’s path constraints leaking, reverse engineering using path-sensitive techniques such as symbolic execution and theorem proving poses a new threat to software intellectual property protection. In order to mitigate path information leaking problem, this paper proposed a novel branch obfuscation scheme that uses binary code side effects to hide path constraints and takes advantage of remote trusted entity to protect software’s control flow graph, without changing software’s functionality. The experimental results show that this branch obfuscation technique could effectively protect software’s path constraints against state-of-the-art reverse engineering, yet practical in terms of performance.},

  abstract = {Code obfuscation has become an essential practice in modern software development, designed to make source or machine code challenging for both humans and computers to comprehend. It plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by protecting intellectual property, safeguarding trade secrets, and preventing unauthorized access or reverse engineering. However, the lack of transparency in obfuscated code raises significant ethical concerns, including the potential for harmful or unethical uses such as hidden data collection, malicious features, back doors, and concealed vulnerabilities. These issues highlight the need for a balanced approach that ensures the protection of developers’ intellectual property while addressing ethical responsibilities related to user privacy, transparency, and societal impact. This paper investigates various code obfuscation techniques, their benefits, challenges, and practical applications, underscoring their relevance in contemporary software development. This study examines obfuscation methods and tools, evaluates machine learning models—including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine—and presents experimental results aimed at classifying obfuscated versus non-obfuscated files. Our findings demonstrate that these models achieve high accuracy in identifying obfuscation methods employed by tools such as Jlaive, Oxyry, PyObfuscate, Pyarmor, and py-obfuscator. This research also addresses emerging ethical concerns and proposes guidelines for a balanced, responsible approach to code obfuscation.},

  abstract = {Software obfuscation is a crucial technology to protect intellectual property. Despite its importance, commercial and academic state-of-the-art obfuscation approaches are vulnerable to a plethora of automated deobfuscation attacks, such as symbolic execution, taint analysis, or program synthesis. While several enhanced techniques were proposed to thwart taint analysis or symbolic execution, they either impose a prohibitive runtime overhead or can be removed by compiler optimizations. In general, they suffer from focusing on a single attack vector, allowing an attacker to switch to other more effective techniques, such as program synthesis. In this work, we present LOKI, an approach for code obfuscation that is resilient against all known automated deobfuscation attacks. To this end, we deploy multiple techniques, including a generic approach to synthesize formally verified expressions of arbitrary complexity. Contrary to state-of-theart approaches that rely on a few hardcoded generation rules, our expressions are more diverse and harder to pattern match against. Moreover, LOKI protects against previously unaccounted attack vectors such as program synthesis, for which it reduces the success rate to merely 19\%. Overall, our design incurs significantly less overhead while providing a much stronger protection level.},

  abstract = {Software obfuscation has always been a controversially discussed research area. While theoretical results indicate that provably secure obfuscation in general is impossible, its widespread application in malware and commercial software shows that it is nevertheless popular in practice. Still, it remains largely unexplored to what extent today’s software obfuscations keep up with state-of-the-art code analysis and where we stand in the arms race between software developers and code analysts. The main goal of this survey is to analyze the effectiveness of different classes of software obfuscation against the continuously improving deobfuscation techniques and off-the-shelf code analysis tools.          The answer very much depends on the goals of the analyst and the available resources. On the one hand, many forms of lightweight static analysis have difficulties with even basic obfuscation schemes, which explains the unbroken popularity of obfuscation among malware writers. On the other hand, more expensive analysis techniques, in particular when used interactively by a human analyst, can easily defeat many obfuscations. As a result, software obfuscation for the purpose of intellectual property protection remains highly challenging.},

According to our experimental results, our models have up to 98\% accuracy at detecting and deob-fuscating state-of-the-art opaque predicates patterns. By contrast, the leading edge deobfuscation methods based on symbolic execution show less accuracy mostly due to the SMT solvers constraints and the lack of scalability of dynamic symbolic analyses. Our approach underlines the efficiency of hybrid symbolic analysis and machine learning techniques for a static and generic deobfuscation methodology.},

Symbolic execution has been one of the most powerful techniques in discovering such malicious code and analyzing the trigger condition. We propose a novel automatic malware obfuscation technique to make analysis based on symbolic execution difficult. Unlike previously proposed techniques, the obfuscated code from our tool does not use any cryptographic operations and makes use of only linear operations which symbolic execution is believed to be good in analyzing. The obfuscated code incorporates unsolved conjectures and adds a simple loop to the original code, making it less than one hundred bytes longer and hard to be differentiated from normal programs. Evaluation shows that applying symbolic execution to the obfuscated code is inefficient in finding the trigger condition. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of the proposed technique.},

  abstract = {Software obfuscation has been developed for over 30 years. A problem always confusing the communities is what security strength the technique can achieve. Nowadays, this problem becomes even harder as the software economy becomes more diversified. Inspired by the classic idea of layered security for risk management, we propose layered obfuscation as a promising way to realize reliable software obfuscation. Our concept is based on the fact that real-world software is usually complicated. Merely applying one or several obfuscation approaches in an ad-hoc way cannot achieve good obscurity. Layered obfuscation, on the other hand, aims to mitigate the risks of reverse software engineering by integrating different obfuscation techniques as a whole solution. In the paper, we conduct a systematic review of existing obfuscation techniques based on the idea of layered obfuscation and develop a novel taxonomy of obfuscation techniques. Following our taxonomy hierarchy, the obfuscation strategies under different branches are orthogonal to each other. In this way, it can assist developers in choosing obfuscation techniques and designing layered obfuscation solutions based on their specific requirements.},

  abstract = {Control-flow obfuscation increases program complexity by semantic-preserving transformation. Opaque predicates are essential gadgets to achieve such transformation. However, we observe that real-world opaque predicates are generally very simple and engage little security consideration. Recently, such insecure opaque predicates have been severely attacked by symbolic execution-based adversaries and jeopardize the security of control-flow obfuscation. This paper, therefore, proposes symbolic opaque predicates which can be resilient to symbolic execution-based adversaries. We design a general framework to compose such opaque predicates, which requires introducing challenging symbolic analysis problems (e.g., symbolic memory) in each opaque predicate. In this way, we may mislead symbolic execution engines into reaching false conclusions. We observe a novel bi-opaque property about symbolic opaque predicates, which can incur not only false negative issues but also false positive issues to attackers. To evaluate the efficacy of our idea, we have implemented a prototype obfuscation tool based on Obfuscator-LLVM and conduct experiments with real-world programs. Our evaluation results show that symbolic opaque predicates demonstrate excellent resilience to prevalent symbolic execution engines, such as BAP, Triton, and Angr. Moreover, although the costs of symbolic opaque predicates may vary for different problem settings, some predicates can be very efficient. Therefore, our framework is both secure and usable. Users can follow the framework to introduce symbolic opaque predicates into their obfuscation tools and made them more powerful.},

  abstract = {Program obfuscation is a widely employed approach for software intellectual property protection. However, general obfuscation methods (e.g., lexical obfuscation, control obfuscation) implemented in mainstream obfuscation tools are heuristic and have little security guarantee. Recently in 2013, Garg et al. have achieved a breakthrough in secure program obfuscation with a graded encoding mechanism and they have shown that it can fulfill a compelling security property, i.e., indistinguishability. Nevertheless, the mechanism incurs too much overhead for practical usage. Besides, it focuses on obfuscating computation models (e.g., circuits) rather than real codes. In this paper, we aim to explore secure and usable obfuscation approaches from the literature. Our main finding is that currently we still have no such approaches made secure and usable. The main reason is we do not have adequate evaluation metrics concerning both security and performance. On one hand, existing code-oriented obfuscation approaches generally evaluate the increased obscurity rather than security guarantee. On the other hand, the performance requirement for model-oriented obfuscation approaches is too weak to develop practical program obfuscation solutions.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a program obfuscation framework that uses covert channels through the program’s execution environment to obfuscate information flow through the program. Unlike prior works on obfuscation, the use of covert channels removes visible information flows from the computation of the program and reroutes them through the program’s runtime system and/or the operating system. This renders these information flows, and the corresponding control and data dependencies, invisible to program analysis tools such as symbolic execution engines. Additionally, we present the idea of probabilistic obfuscation which uses imperfect covert channels to leak information with some probabilistic guarantees. Experimental evaluation of our approach against state of the art detection and analysis techniques show the engines are not well-equipped to handle these obfuscations, particularly those of the probabilistic variety.},
